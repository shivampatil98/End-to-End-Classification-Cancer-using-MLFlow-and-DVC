# Project Overview

This project focuses on building a robust, end-to-end cancer classification system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The pipeline leverages MLFlow for experiment tracking, DVC for data versioning, and utilizes Docker and AWS for containerization and cloud deployment, ensuring scalability and efficient model management.
